# (Theory) Cloud Computing
## (Simplified) How websites work
We have a server hosted somewhere and we, as a web browser, wants to get access to the server to visualize a website. 

The client (us) will use a network between ourselves and the server. The client will find the network and will use the network to route the packets, the data into the server.

Then, the server will then reply to us allowing us to view the website.

## How do clients find the server and vice-versa?

They both require an IP address. An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. 
(i.e You (cleint) sending letter to a house address / consider the post-office as a network / address you put will be routed to the destination (server))
